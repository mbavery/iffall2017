		<p class="verse">When I was a boy I lived on Poplar Street
		<br>Just a little child with plasters on my knees
		<br>Watching all the world from high up in the trees
		<br>I saw Mrs Moore sleep 'round with Mr Keats</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chorus">I feel like a new man
		<br>Red flowers in my bed
		<br>Breathe straight through the crisp air
		<br>Dead flowers in the sand
		<br>I am a true romantic
		<br>Free falling love addict, and
		<br>I am a true romantic
		<br>Free falling love addict, yeah</p>

		<p class="verse">Mama always called that woman prosti-tits
		<br>For wearing lower cuts than most and red lipstick
		<br>One night Mrs Moore she made her eyes at me
		<br>Pulled me through her door and stuck her teeth in deep</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chorus">I feel like a new man
		<br>Red flowers in my bed
		<br>Breathe straight through the crisp air
		<br>Dead flowers in the sand
		<br>I am a true romantic
		<br>Free falling love addict, and
		<br>I am a true romantic
		<br>Free falling love addict, yeah</p>

		<br>
		<p class="verse">And all your days are gone
		<br>Sitting on the floor
		<br>In your underwear
		<br>Begging me for more
		<br>And all my days are gone
		<br>Sitting on the floor
		<br>In my underwear
		<br>Begging you for more
		<br>'Cause</p>
		<br>
		<p class="chorus">I am a true romantic
		<br>Free falling love addict, and
		<br>I am a true romantic
		<br>Free falling love addict, yeah</p>

		<p class="verse">Just another boy who lived on Poplar Street
		<br>Tangled up in lust and her exotic needs
		<br>One night, Mrs Moore, she called collect to me
		<br>"I don't love you anymore," she said and ceased to be
		<br>Just another boy
		<br>Just another boy
		<br>Just another boy</p>
